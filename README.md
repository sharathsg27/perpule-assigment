This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs the dependencies required to run the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Movies API`

I've feteched data from http://www.omdbapi.com/. But it had limited number of record count of "10" for GET request. I've managed to add Pagination for the limited count. It can be scaled with other API's with larger datasets too.
